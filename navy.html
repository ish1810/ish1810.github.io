The Indian Navy is the naval branch of the armed forces of India. With 55,000 men
 and women, including 5,000 naval aviation personnel and 2,000 Marine Commandos 
(MARCOS), it is the world’s fifth largest navy. The Indian Navy currently operates
 more than 155 vessels, including the aircraft carrier INS Viraat.
India uses its navy to enhance its international relations through joint exercises,
port visits, and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief. The Indian Navy
is increasing its capabilities as a true blue-water navy; the Indian Navy’s doctrine
states that this is for the collective good of nations
